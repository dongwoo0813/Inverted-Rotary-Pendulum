# Inverted-Rotary-Pendulum
This is MATLAB file that I made using ChatGPT. It has some flaws in the EOM because there is no realistic limit to the arm angle.

However, the reason for making these simulation and animation file was to discover the practicality of ChatGPT in my free time.


This nonlinear system has PID controller built-in.

There are many future plan that I want to do, which includes building a controller that enables to raise the pendulum from 0 degree to 180 degree, etc.
Also, I plan to make it more realistic.
